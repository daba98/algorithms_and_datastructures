# Algorithms and Datastructures -Java
This repository contains some generic datastructures like graph, segment-tree, or Fibonacci-heap, and implementations of some algorithms like the Dijkstra algorithm for finding shortest paths or the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for computing maximal flows. The implementations are intended for learning purposes and as such they are not trimmed to performance and may be less efficient than equivalent implementations.
